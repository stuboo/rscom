# BOTOX® Injections for Urinary Incontinence

BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) injections offer an effective treatment option for patients with overactive bladder (OAB) who haven't found adequate relief from more conservative therapies.

## How BOTOX® Works for Bladder Control

BOTOX® works by temporarily paralyzing the overactive muscles in the bladder that cause urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. 

- The medication is injected directly into the bladder muscle during a simple in-office procedure.
- It helps reduce involuntary contractions of the bladder, giving you better control over your urination.
- Effects typically last 6-9 months before retreatment is needed.

Dr. Stewart says: "BOTOX® injections can provide significant relief for many patients with persistent OAB symptoms. It's a versatile treatment that can be particularly helpful for those who can't tolerate or don't respond well to oral medications."

## The BOTOX® Procedure

The procedure is relatively quick and can usually be performed in the office:

1. Your bladder is numbed with a local anesthetic.
2. A thin scope (cystoscope) is inserted through the urethra into your bladder.
3. Using the scope, your doctor injects small amounts of BOTOX® into multiple areas of your bladder muscle.
4. The entire procedure typically takes about 30 minutes.

Most patients can return to their normal activities the same day, although you may experience some discomfort or urinary symptoms for a few days after the procedure.

## Benefits of BOTOX® for OAB

- Significant reduction in daily urinary incontinence episodes
- Improved quality of life
- Decreased urinary urgency and frequency
- Effects last several months, reducing the need for daily medication

## Potential Side Effects and Considerations

While generally safe and effective, BOTOX® treatment for OAB does come with some potential risks:

- Urinary tract infection
- Difficulty urinating or inability to empty the bladder completely
- Blood in the urine
- Fatigue

Dr. Stewart notes, "We carefully screen patients to ensure they're good candidates for BOTOX® therapy. For those who are suitable, it can be a game-changer in managing their OAB symptoms."

## Is BOTOX® a Good Choice for You?

BOTOX® may be an option if you:
- Have moderate to severe OAB symptoms
- Haven't found adequate relief from lifestyle changes and first-line medications
- Are willing to undergo periodic injections for ongoing symptom management
- Don't have certain neurological conditions or other contraindications

We'll discuss your specific situation, symptoms, and treatment history to determine if BOTOX® injections could be a good fit for your bladder control needs.
