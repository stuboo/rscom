# Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy for Urinary Incontinence

Pelvic floor physical therapy is a specialized form of treatment that goes far beyond simple Kegel exercises. It's a comprehensive approach to improving pelvic floor function and addressing urinary incontinence. At our practice, we highly recommend pelvic floor physical therapy as a cornerstone of conservative treatment for many patients.

## More Than Just Kegels

While Kegel exercises are an important component of pelvic floor rehabilitation, they're just one piece of a much larger puzzle. A skilled pelvic floor physical therapist addresses multiple aspects of your physical well-being:

- **Breathing Techniques**: Proper breathing patterns can significantly impact pelvic floor function. Your therapist will teach you how to coordinate your breath with pelvic floor movements.

- **Posture Correction**: Your posture affects the position and function of your pelvic organs. Improving posture can alleviate stress on the pelvic floor.

- **Mobility Work**: Restrictions in your hips, lower back, or abdomen can affect pelvic floor function. Your therapist will work on improving overall mobility in these areas.

- **Core Strength**: A strong core works in tandem with the pelvic floor. Your therapy will likely include exercises to improve core stability.

- **Relaxation Techniques**: Sometimes, the pelvic floor muscles are too tense. Learning to relax these muscles can be just as important as strengthening them.

> "Pelvic floor physical therapy is about whole-body wellness. We look at how everything from your breathing to your hip mobility affects your pelvic health." - Dr. Ryan Stewart

## What to Expect in a Session

Each pelvic floor physical therapy session is tailored to your specific needs and comfort level. Here's what you might expect:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Your first visit will involve a comprehensive evaluation of your pelvic floor strength, coordination, and overall physical condition.

2. **Customized Treatment Plan**: Based on the assessment, your therapist will develop a personalized treatment plan.

3. **Education**: You'll learn about pelvic floor anatomy and how it relates to your symptoms.

4. **Exercises**: Your therapist will guide you through various exercises, both for in-session work and home practice.

5. **Manual Therapy**: This might include external techniques on your lower back, hips, or abdomen.

6. **Biofeedback**: Some sessions may use biofeedback devices to help you visualize your pelvic floor muscle activity.

## Your Comfort is Priority

It's crucial to understand that you are always in control during your physical therapy sessions. Here are some key points to remember:

- **Consent is Crucial**: Any internal work, such as internal pelvic floor muscle assessment or treatment, will only be done with your explicit consent.

- **Communication is Key**: Feel free to express any discomfort or concerns to your therapist at any time.

- **Flexibility in Treatment**: If you're not comfortable with certain aspects of treatment on any given day, your therapist can adjust the session accordingly.

- **External Options**: Many beneficial techniques can be performed externally. You can still benefit greatly from physical therapy even if you prefer not to have internal work done.

> "Your comfort and consent are our top priorities. We want you to feel empowered and in control throughout the entire course of your treatment." - Dr. Ryan Stewart
