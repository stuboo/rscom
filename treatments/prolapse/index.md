# Prolapse Treatments

Pelvic organ prolapse is a common condition that affects many women, particularly after childbirth or as they age. While it can be concerning, there are numerous effective treatment options available. This page provides an overview of the various approaches to managing and treating prolapse.

## Understanding Your Options

Treatment for prolapse is not one-size-fits-all. The best approach depends on several factors, including:

- The type and severity of your prolapse
- Your symptoms and how they affect your quality of life
- Your overall health and medical history
- Your personal preferences and goals

Your urogynecologist will work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that addresses your unique needs.

## Conservative Treatments

Many women find relief through non-surgical options:

### Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy
- Strengthens the muscles supporting your pelvic organs
- Can improve symptoms and prevent worsening of prolapse
- Typically involves exercises and, sometimes, biofeedback training

### Pessaries
- Removable devices inserted into the vagina to support prolapsed organs
- Available in various shapes and sizes to suit individual needs
- Can be an excellent option for women who want to avoid surgery

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Weight management to reduce pressure on pelvic organs
- Avoiding heavy lifting and high-impact activities
- Treating chronic cough or constipation

## Surgical Treatments

When conservative measures aren't sufficient, surgical options may be considered:

### Reconstructive Surgery
- Aims to restore the normal position of pelvic organs
- Can be performed through the vagina or abdomen (laparoscopically)
- May use your own tissues or synthetic mesh for support

### Obliterative Surgery
- Closes off the vaginal canal
- Typically for women who are no longer sexually active and have no desire to be in the future
- Highly effective but impacts sexual function

## Making Your Decision

Choosing the right treatment involves careful consideration. Your doctor will provide detailed information about each option, including potential benefits and risks. Don't hesitate to ask questions and express your concerns during your consultation.

## Next Steps

If you're experiencing symptoms of prolapse or have concerns about your pelvic health:

1. Schedule a consultation with a urogynecologist
2. Prepare a list of your symptoms and questions
3. Consider bringing a trusted friend or family member to your appointment for support

Remember, prolapse is a manageable condition. With the right treatment approach, many women experience significant improvement in their symptoms and quality of life.
