# Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy for Prolapse

Pelvic floor physical therapy is a highly effective, non-invasive treatment option for many women experiencing pelvic organ prolapse. This specialized form of physical therapy goes far beyond simple Kegel exercises, offering a comprehensive approach to pelvic health.

## What is Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy?

Pelvic floor physical therapy involves a range of techniques and exercises designed to:

- Strengthen and coordinate pelvic floor muscles
- Improve overall pelvic function
- Enhance breathing patterns
- Correct and improve posture
- Increase mobility and flexibility
- Address any muscle imbalances or tensions in related areas

These sessions are led by specially trained physical therapists who have expertise in pelvic health.

## More Than Just Kegels

While Kegel exercises can be beneficial, pelvic floor physical therapy encompasses much more:

1. **Breathing techniques**: Proper breathing patterns can significantly impact pelvic floor function.
2. **Posture correction**: Your posture affects the positioning and functioning of your pelvic organs and pelvic floor.
3. **Mobility exercises**: Improving flexibility in your hips, lower back, and abdomen can support better pelvic floor health.
4. **Core strengthening**: A strong core works in tandem with your pelvic floor for better support.
5. **Relaxation techniques**: Learning to fully relax your pelvic floor is just as important as strengthening it.
