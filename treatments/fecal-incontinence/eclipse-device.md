# Eclipse™ Device for Fecal Incontinence

The Eclipse™ System is an innovative, non-surgical solution for women suffering from fecal incontinence, also known as accidental bowel leakage. This vaginal insert offers a unique approach to managing bowel control issues without the need for surgery or medications.

## What is the Eclipse Device?

The Eclipse System is a vaginal insert designed to use your body's own anatomy to help prevent accidental bowel leakage. It's a removable device that can be inserted and removed by the user, similar to a tampon or diaphragm.

## How the Eclipse Device Works

1. **Vaginal Insert**: The device is placed in the vagina, in a similar location to a tampon or diaphragm.

2. **Inflatable Balloon**: The insert has a balloon that can be inflated or deflated.

3. **Detachable Pump**: A small, discreet pump is used to control the balloon.

4. **Bowel Control**: When inflated, the balloon puts gentle pressure on the rectum, helping to prevent stool from passing when you're not ready.

5. **User Control**: When you're ready to have a bowel movement, you simply deflate the balloon using the pump.
