# Sacral Neuromodulation for Fecal Incontinence

Sacral Neuromodulation (SNM) is an advanced therapy option for patients with fecal incontinence who haven't found relief through more conservative treatments. This minimally invasive approach uses a small implanted device to modulate the nerves controlling bowel function, potentially restoring normal communication between the brain and the bowel.

## How Sacral Neuromodulation Works

{: .important-title }

> It seems like magic, but it's science
>
> SNM targets the root cause of fecal incontinence by addressing the miscommunication between the brain and bowel.

1. A small device is implanted under the skin in the upper buttock area.
2. The device sends gentle electrical pulses to the sacral nerves, which control bowel function.
3. These pulses can help restore normal nerve activity, improving bowel control.

## Benefits of Sacral Neuromodulation

- Clinically proven effectiveness for long-term symptom relief
- Minimally invasive procedure
- Fully reversible therapy
- Can be trialed before permanent implantation
- May reduce or eliminate the need for medications or more invasive surgeries

## The Sacral Neuromodulation Journey

### 1. Consultation
Discuss with your doctor if SNM might be right for you. 

### 2. Evaluation Period
Before committing to long-term therapy, you'll undergo a trial period:
- A temporary lead is placed near the sacral nerves.
- You'll use an external device to control the stimulation.
- This trial typically lasts about a week, allowing you to experience the potential benefits.

### 3. Permanent Implantation
If the trial is successful, you'll discuss with your doctor about proceeding with the full implant.

### 4. Long-Term Therapy
After implantation, you'll work with your healthcare provider to optimize your settings for the best symptom control.

## Device Options

Two main systems are available for sacral neuromodulation:

### Medtronic InterStim™ System

- Offers both rechargeable and non-rechargeable options
- InterStim X™: Non-rechargeable, lasts 10-15 years depending on settings
- InterStim™ Micro: Rechargeable, 15-year battery life, weekly 20-minute recharging
- Both are MRI compatible under certain conditions

### Axonics® System

- AxonicsF15™: Non-rechargeable ("recharge-free"), lasts 10-20 years
- AxonicsR20™: Rechargeable, designed to last 20+ years, 6-10 months between charges
- Both allow for full-body MRI scans under certain conditions

## Effectiveness

Clinical studies have shown significant improvements in fecal incontinence symptoms with sacral neuromodulation:

- 84% of patients achieved clinically significant improvements at 2 years post-implantation
- 93% of patients reported satisfaction with their therapy

## Is Sacral Neuromodulation Right for You?

SNM may be an option if you:
- Have chronic fecal incontinence
- Have tried conservative treatments without success
- Are not a candidate for, or prefer to avoid, more invasive surgical procedures

## Take the Next Step

If you're struggling with fecal incontinence and are interested in learning more about sacral neuromodulation, schedule a consultation with Dr. Stewart. We can assess your condition, discuss whether SNM might be right for you, and guide you through the evaluation process if appropriate.

Remember, sacral neuromodulation is a powerful tool in managing fecal incontinence, offering many patients significant improvement in their symptoms and quality of life. With the option to try the therapy before committing, you can make an informed decision about your long-term treatment plan.
