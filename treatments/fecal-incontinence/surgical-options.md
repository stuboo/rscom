# Surgical Options for Fecal Incontinence

While surgical interventions are available for fecal incontinence, it's crucial to understand that these options are considered **very rarely**. The vast majority of patients find significant relief through conservative treatments and minimally invasive options.

> Surgical procedures for fecal incontinence are typically considered only after all other treatment options have been exhausted.

## Why Surgery is Rarely Recommended

1. **Effectiveness of Conservative Therapies**: Non-surgical treatments such as dietary changes, pelvic floor physical therapy, and sacral neuromodulation are often highly effective in managing fecal incontinence.

2. **Risks and Complications**: Surgical procedures carry higher risks of complications compared to conservative treatments.

3. **Limited Long-Term Success**: Some surgical options have shown limited long-term effectiveness in treating fecal incontinence.

4. **Impact on Quality of Life**: Certain surgical interventions, while potentially effective, may significantly impact a patient's quality of life in other ways.

## Conservative Treatments: The First Line of Defense

Before considering any surgical option, it's essential to explore and exhaust all conservative treatments. These include:

1. [Dietary Adjustments](/treatments/fecal-incontinence/dietary-adjustments)
2. [Bowel Retraining](/treatments/fecal-incontinence/bowel-retraining)
3. [Physical Therapy](/treatments/fecal-incontinence/physical-therapy)
4. [Eclipseâ„¢ System](/treatments/fecal-incontinence/eclipse-device)

## Minimally Invasive Options

If conservative treatments don't provide sufficient relief, minimally invasive options should be considered before surgery:

1. [Sacral Neuromodulation](/treatments/fecal-incontinence/sacral-neuromodulation)

These treatments often provide significant improvement with much lower risks compared to surgical options.

## Surgical Procedures: A Last Resort

In rare cases where all other treatments have failed, surgical options may be considered. However, it's important to understand their limitations:

### 1. Sphincteroplasty

- Involves repairing damaged anal sphincter muscles
- High morbidity rate
- Less effective than sacral neuromodulation for most patients

### 2. Artificial Bowel Sphincter

- Implantation of a device to control bowel movements
- Low success rates
- High complication rates

### 3. Fecal Diversion (Ostomy)

- Creation of an opening in the abdomen for stool to pass into a bag
- While effective, it's often perceived negatively by patients due to its impact on body image and lifestyle
