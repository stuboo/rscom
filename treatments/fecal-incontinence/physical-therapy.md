# Physical Therapy for Fecal Incontinence

Physical therapy is a crucial component in the conservative management of fecal incontinence. It focuses on strengthening and improving the coordination of the pelvic floor muscles, which play a vital role in bowel control.

## Understanding Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy

Pelvic floor physical therapy is a specialized form of treatment that targets the muscles, ligaments, and connective tissues of the pelvic area. For fecal incontinence, it aims to improve the strength and function of the anal sphincter and surrounding muscles.
