# My Path to Medicine: A Personal Story

Patients often ask me about my background, so I thought I'd share how I found my way to medicine. It wasn't a straightforward journey—more of a winding path with some unexpected turns.

I grew up in a small town in Middle Tennessee, playing football until an injury introduced me to Dr. David Schmidt, a hand surgeon who was my first real glimpse into the medical world. That moment sparked something in me—a curiosity about medicine that would eventually become my career.

In college, I bounced between majors—biology, then chemistry—always drawn to understanding how things work. But I also loved being outdoors. So between academic pursuits, I worked with [Mountain Challenge](https://www.mtnchallenge.com), traveled through Central America, and even worked as a house parent at Milton Hershey School and a development officer at Maryville College.

The pull of medicine never left me. I studied for the MCAT, applied to medical school, and graduated from the Via College of Osteopathic Medicine in Blacksburg, VA. Clinical rotations in Asheville, a residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Indiana University, and a fellowship at the University of Louisville followed.

Today, I'm practicing in Green Bay, Wisconsin, bringing all those experiences—the travel, the diverse roles, the academic training—into my approach to patient care. Each step of my journey has taught me something about connection, understanding, and the importance of seeing the whole person.
