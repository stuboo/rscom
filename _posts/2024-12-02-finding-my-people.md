Sometimes life's most profound paths aren't linear—they're a beautiful, winding road of discovery. As I sit here in my new office in Green Bay, Wisconsin, I can't help but reflect on the journey that brought me to urogynecology, a specialty that chose me as much as I chose it.

My path wasn't traditional. Before medical school, I wore many hats: marketing director, pharmaceutical representative, world traveler, fundraiser, and even a house parent. Each experience was a puzzle piece, slowly revealing a bigger picture of who I was meant to become.

The secret to professional happiness, I've learned, isn't about the most prestigious title or the highest salary. It's about finding your people—those individuals with whom your passion aligns, where your work feels less like a job and more like a calling.

For me, those people are the patients of urogynecology. They're the women seeking to improve their quality of life, to reclaim comfort and confidence. They're the healthcare professionals who approach each day with compassion and precision. They're my people.

When I first entered medical school, I knew obstetrics and gynecology felt like home. The offices, the practitioners, the environment—it all resonated with me. As I delved deeper, I discovered my true passion: helping post-reproductive women through surgical interventions that enhance their daily lives.

Green Bay has already shown me incredible warmth and generosity. As I begin this new chapter, I'm not just starting a medical practice; I'm building relationships, creating a community of care and understanding.

To my future patients and colleagues: I'm here, I'm ready, and I'm excited to work alongside you. Together, we'll navigate health challenges, celebrate victories, and continuously improve quality of life.

This isn't just a job. This is my calling. These are my people.

Welcome to our journey.
