When I reflect on how I became a urogynecologist, I realize my path was never about a straight line, but about discovering where I truly belonged.

Ten years after college, I had lived multiple professional lives. I'd been a marketing director, a pharmaceutical representative at Eli Lilly, a traveler in Central America, a college fundraiser, and a house parent. Each role wasn't a detour—it was a step toward understanding myself.

The recurring question throughout my journey wasn't "What should I do?" but "Who are my people?"

My exposure to OBGYN during my time as a pharmaceutical rep gave me my first glimpse. I noticed how comfortable I felt in those medical offices, how the dynamics and interactions resonated with me. When I entered medical school in my thirties, I was already drawn to this world.

As I progressed through my training, my understanding refined. I discovered I preferred working with post-reproductive female patients. I enjoyed surgery more than obstetrics. I was drawn to helping healthy patients improve their quality of life rather than managing critical illnesses.

Urogynecology wasn't just a specialty—it was a calling.

Now, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, after two months of transition, I feel a profound sense of gratitude. The warmth of this community, their generosity in welcoming my family, reinforces that I'm exactly where I'm meant to be.

My professional journey has never been about achieving a predetermined destination. It's been about listening—to myself, to the patients I serve, to the subtle signals that guide us toward our most authentic work.

Today, as I start my new practice, I'm happy to be someone who has found his place, his community, his purpose.
