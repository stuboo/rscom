# Urogynecological Conditions

As a urogynecologist, I specialize in diagnosing and treating a wide range of pelvic floor disorders that affect women. These conditions can significantly impact quality of life, but with proper care and treatment, many women find relief and improved well-being. Below, you'll find information about some of the most common conditions I treat.

## Conditions We Treat

### Pelvic Organ Prolapse
Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when the muscles and tissues supporting the pelvic organs (uterus, bladder, rectum) become weak or loose, causing one or more pelvic organs to drop or press into or out of the vagina.

### Urinary Incontinence
This condition involves the involuntary leakage of urine. There are several types:
- **Stress Incontinence**: Leakage during physical activities like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise.
- **Urge Incontinence**: A sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by an involuntary loss of urine.
- **Mixed Incontinence**: A combination of stress and urge incontinence.

### Overactive Bladder (OAB)
OAB is characterized by frequent, sudden urges to urinate that are difficult to control, often accompanied by increased urinary frequency and nocturia (nighttime urination).

### Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)
Some women experience frequent UTIs, which can cause discomfort and disruption to daily life. We offer comprehensive evaluation and management strategies for recurrent UTIs.

### Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome
This chronic condition causes pain and pressure in the bladder area, often accompanied by urinary frequency and urgency.

### Fecal Incontinence
The inability to control bowel movements, leading to unexpected leakage of stool.

### Vaginal Fistulas
Abnormal connections between the vagina and other pelvic organs (such as the bladder or rectum) that can cause leakage of urine or stool into the vagina.

### Pelvic Pain
Chronic pain in the pelvic region can have various causes and may be associated with other pelvic floor disorders.

### Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM)
Previously known as vaginal atrophy, GSM involves various menopausal symptoms affecting the genitourinary system, including vaginal dryness, irritation, and painful intercourse.

Each of these conditions can significantly impact a woman's quality of life, but with proper diagnosis and treatment, many patients experience substantial improvement. If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, I encourage you to schedule an appointment for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan.

Remember, you're not alone in dealing with these conditions, and help is available. Together, we can work towards improving your pelvic health and overall well-being.
