### My Expertise
I specialize in treating:
- Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP)
- Urinary Incontinence
- Overactive Bladder
- Fecal Incontinence
- Vaginal Fistulas
- Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections
- Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM)

### About Me
- Fellowship-trained in Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (Urogynecology) at the University of Louisville School of Medicine
- Completed residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Indiana University School of Medicine
- Graduated from Via College of Osteopathic Medicine in Blacksburg, Virginia
- Constantly seeking ways to improve patient education, efficiency, and the patient experience.
- I like backyard chickens, treehouses, computer programming, tinkering, popcorn, bluegrass music, and playing LEGO with my wife and son.

### My Approach
The word doctor arises from the Latin word *docere*, which means, “to teach.” This is the basis of my patient care philosophy. I want you to leave every appointment feeling as though you’ve learned more about yourself and your condition than when you arrived — so that we can use our shared knowledge to develop a treatment plan that meets your goals (not mine).

I divide my time equally between office consultations and surgical procedures, ensuring comprehensive care for all patients. I am committed to advancing the field of pelvic health through ongoing research and application of the latest medical research and technology.
